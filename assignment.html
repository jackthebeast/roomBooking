<!--
Usecase
-->
<h3>Usecase</h3>
<p>
An important feature of access mangement systems is room booking. It 
allows employees to see which rooms are avaible and to book them 
whenever they need them.<br>
A good room booking system has to be very easy to use from any device 
so that employees can use it frequently without loosing time.<br>
If implemented right, it enables the company to release a large number 
of rooms for use by all employees on a as-needed basis. This means that 
real estate can be used much more efficiently and that employees always 
work in the enviroment in which they are the most productive at their 
current task.
</p>

Task
-->
<h3>Task</h3>
<p>
Your task is to create a simple prototype app of such a room booking system 
that uses data provided by the API hosted under the url you are 
viewing this document from. You can use whatever languages and 
frameworks you like as long as the final result is a truly native, "non-web" app 
and you are not using a second backend of your own to process the data 
provided by the API.
</p>

<!--
Design
-->
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>
There are (almost) no design requirements and you can rearrange the 
elments in any way you like. It's your task to create a design and 
corresponding interface elements that you think are the most intuitive 
and easy to use for the users of the system. You can also decide if you 
opt for a tablet or phone optimzed design<br>
We encourage you to use animations when suitable and to create highly 
interactive and responsive interface elements accordingly (Think about 
how unintuitive it is to enter the time via a long dropdown compared to 
the way apple did it on iOS).<br>
In order to match our corperate design, please use the following colors 
and variations of them (lighter,darker,etc) whenever you can:<br>
</p>
<div class="cbox"><div style="background:#00A0DB;"></div><br>#00A0DB</div>
<div class="cbox"><div style="background:#362A83;"></div><br>#362A83</div>
<div class="cbox"><div style="background:#A01F80;"></div><br>#A01F80</div>
<div class="cbox"><div style="background:#E40274;"></div><br>#E40274</div>
<div class="cbox"><div style="background:#E31E2F;"></div><br>#E31E2F</div>
<div class="cbox"><div style="background:#EC7B23;"></div><br>#EC7B23</div>
<div class="cbox"><div style="background:#FFE900;"></div><br>#FFE900</div>
<div class="cbox"><div style="background:#9ABD36;"></div><br>#9ABD36</div>
<div class="cbox"><div style="background:#009547;"></div><br>#009547</div>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>

Functional Requirements

<h3>Functional Requirements</h3>
<p>
The following mockups are only illustrative and do not represent an 
actual design you have to follow.
</p>
<h4>Search</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>
Upon opening the app all rooms that are avaiable for the user today 
should be loaded and displayed to him. As soon as he selects or enters 
a new date, the list is refreshed.<br>
<img src="./assignment_files/illu-app-01.png" alt=""><br>
The user should be able to filter the results by different parameters. 
Implement at least two filters: a room name search and a way to find 
rooms that are avaiable during the next hour. You can also add more 
filters if you want (equipment, capacity, size, etc). The list should 
always update itself instantly when working with filters.<br>
<img src="./assignment_files/illu-app-02.png" alt=""><br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Room Information</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>
The most important data provided by the API is the current booking 
shedule. It contains a list of times during which the room has been 
booked. All rooms are only avaiable between 7AM and 7PM and can be 
booked in 15min steps. We want you to create a new visual element that 
enables  users to see immediately at which times of the day a room is 
avaiable. 
We have found that a colored "time bar" works quite well, but you can 
also try to find a better way<br>
<img src="./assignment_files/illu-app-03.png" alt=""><br>
Additional information is provided for every room: room name, location, 
size&amp;capacity, available equipment and up to 3 images. It's probably 
best to not display all information at once and to provide the user a 
detailed view when he selects a room.<br>
<img src="./assignment_files/illu-app-04.png" alt=""><br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Room booking</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>
When users select to book a room, a booking view for the room 
should be revealed. The user has to select the time, enter an event 
description and can add an ulimted number participants.<br>
Selecting time ranges is often clumsy and not intuitive. You can try to 
find a better way to select and adjust the time range, for example with 
simple drag operations on the booking shedule element you created 
before.<br>
<img src="./assignment_files/illu-app-05.png" alt=""><br> 
Users should not be able to choose a time that overlaps with an 
existing booking.<br>
For each atendee, name, email and phone number have to be entered. It 
should be possible to remove atendees that have already been added.<br> 
<img src="./assignment_files/illu-app-06.png" alt=""><br>
All Input fields should be validated and the user should be only 
able to sumbit the form when everything is correct. After the booking 
has been succesfully created, the user should get an apropriate visual 
response. <br>
The API for the challenge is static and  therefore the booking is not 
saved by the backend. If you want, you can make them permanent by 
storing them locally and showing them together with the existing shedules.

<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>
Please produce a <i>short</i>(!!!) documentation listing the tools you 
used and  explaining how you aproached the task. Please also provide a 
copy of the complete project.
</p>

<!--
API
-->
<h3>API</h3>
<p>
The API can accessed via HTTPS/SPDY POST requests containing 
JSON objects. Each function requires certain parameters. If 
invalid data is provided or an error occurs, an error object is 
returned.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint language-js">{ error:
	{ text: "error description",
	  code: /4-digit error code/ } //additional fields may be provided depending on the error
}
</pre>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>
	- All parameters are extensively tested for validity. You have to 
	check the data yourself before you send anything.<br>
	- Timezone "Europe/Berlin" is used for all timestamps, convert them 
	accordingly if necessary.<br>
	- Error handling is important. If an error occurs, the system should 
	react to it.
</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>/getrooms</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>
Returns a list of rooms for a given day, including the booking status. 
</p>
<h5>Parameters</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint language-js">{ date: /UNIX Timestamp/ | "now" | "today" }
</pre>
<h5>Result</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint language-js">[
	//room object
	{
		name: "room name",
		location: "location name",
		equipment: [
			//list of avaiable equipment
			"equipment name",
			...
		],
		size: "NNm²", //size of the room in m²
		capacity: /suggested number of people a room can fit/,
		avail: [
			//list of times at which a room is free and can be booked,
			//between 7 am and 7 pm in 15min steps
			"HH:mm - HH:mm",
			"HH:mm - HH:mm",
			...
		],
		images: [
			//can contain 0-3 images
			"url of image",
			...
		]
	}, 
	...
]
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h4>/sendpass</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>
Books a room and sends LightPasses to all atendees. Room bookings are 
not commited to the room data. However, the system will send emails and 
sms to all atendees and the data has to be valid.<br>
Phone numbers can be entered in most common formats and are parsed and 
converted to E164 internally. If the number is missing a country code, 
it will be treated as a german number.<br>
If an error occurs while sending any of the passes, the process is 
halted and an error is returned (error code&gt;4000) containing the index 
of the pass that could not be send. It's up to you to decide if you 
want to send the remaining passes and/or and how to handle the one that 
couldn't be send.
</p>
<h5>Parameters</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint language-js">{
	//information about the booking
	booking: { 
		date: /UNIX Timestamp/ | "today",
		//only the hour and minute of the time_ timestamps are used, 
		//the day is always determined by date
		time_start: /UNIX Timestamp/,
		time_end: /UNIX Timestamp/,
		title: "event title",
		description: "event description"
		room: "name of the room that is beeing booked"
	 },
	 //information about all atendees
	 //all 3 fields are required
	 passes: [
		{ name: "Any Name",
		  email: "email@example.com",
		  number: "valid phone number"
		},
		...
	 ]
}
</pre>
<h5>Result</h5>
<pre class="prettyprint language-js">{ success: true }
</pre>
